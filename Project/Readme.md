# Montgomery County Noise Complaint Data Engineering Project

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a robust data engineering solution for the Montgomery County Noise Complaint dataset. The dataset includes various reports of noise complaints, which are essential for analyzing disturbance patterns. The primary objectives are:

- **Improve Data Quality**: Enhance the accuracy and consistency of the data.
- **Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval**: Implement scalable data storage solutions and optimize data access.
- **Insightful Data Analysis**: Provide analytical capabilities to uncover trends and patterns in noise complaints across different times and regions.

The end goal is to offer refined and actionable insights to stakeholders like local government and law enforcement agencies. These insights will assist in improving community noise regulations and enforcement strategies, ultimately aiding in better governance and community satisfaction.
